        <h3>Junior Product Design Analyst | World Of Wood: June 2022 - August 2022</h3>
        <p>As part of my collaboration with a Senior Product Designer, I played a key role in optimizing product development by conducting in-depth analysis of historical design data. By meticulously examining patterns and inefficiencies in past designs, I identified
          critical areas where material wastage frequently occurred. Leveraging these insights, I proposed data-driven improvements that were subsequently integrated into upcoming product designs. This proactive approach not only contributed to more sustainable
          and cost-effective
          production practices but also supported the company’s broader goals of reducing waste and
          increasing operational efficiency. Through this experience, I gained valuable exposure to the intersection of design and data analytics, while enhancing my ability to translate complex datasets into actionable strategies that drive tangible outcomes
          in real-world design processes.</p>
